# Typr

Typr is a webservice, its goal is simply to hold information about different fields types, Post Code (UK), Latitude (Decimal Degrees), Mobile Country Code, etc.. 

It then provides an API so other systems can request validation information for a field from it (allowing systems to use the same validation) and to also allow systems to supply a field and be informed on which types the provided field is valid for.
