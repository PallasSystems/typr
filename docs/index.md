# Typr

Typr is a catalog of fields types, it provides a definition for each field with validation criteria, units, and associated information links.

Most platforms will define data schema's using primitive datatypes (e.g. int, string, char, etc..). NoSQL data stores such as [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html) provide a more comprehensive list of field types for data schema's.

This project allows systems to build on this concept, by creating a catalog that other systems can use when defining data schemas.

Systems can use this information to validate and store data for a specific field within a schema.
